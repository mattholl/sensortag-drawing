# sensortag-drawing prototype
This prototype uses a node.js with a [Texas Instruments BLE SensorTag](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/index.shtml?INTC=SensorTag&HQS=sensortag) to stream data to all connected browsers over websockets. This data is then used to update an HTML5 canvas drawing.
